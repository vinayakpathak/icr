# Paths to sync that are NOT stored in git.
#
# Rules:
# - One path per line.
# - Relative paths are resolved from the repo root.
# - Absolute paths (starting with /) are allowed and will be restored to the
#   same absolute location on the server.
# - Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
# - Globs are not expanded; list explicit files or directories.
#
# Auto-detected on this server (review and adjust):
r2_config.json
/root/.vast_api_key
/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
#
# Common examples (uncomment as needed):
# .env
# .env.local
# configs/local/
# secrets/
# /root/.aws/credentials
# /root/.ssh/id_rsa
