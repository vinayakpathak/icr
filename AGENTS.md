- Always activate the local venv before running python.
- Never selectively git add. Anyting that shouldn't be added should be put into gitignore. Always use git add --all after that.
- Always try to reuse functions that have been previously written and tested if possible. If there is a choice between writing a new function from scratch vs writing the new code in a way that it can reuse a previously written and tested function then go with the latter.
